                        <b>MATES GLOBAL</b> has been an active participant in the Australian recruitment industry for the past six years. It is quickly establishing itself as an agency that recognises and understands the needs of its Clients, while doing its utmost to serve these needs.<br>

                        As an Australian-based company with several offices across Australia, Mates Global knows exactly how to attract qualified staff for our Clients.

                        Given that many of our Clients require highly specialised staff, Mates Global takes no shortcuts â€“ we actively headhunt so that we can get in touch with the most relevant and qualified candidates for the vacant position.<br>

                        Moreover, we thoroughly scrutinise applicants at all levels and categorise them according to their skill & knowledge levels, communication abilities and their team work skills.
