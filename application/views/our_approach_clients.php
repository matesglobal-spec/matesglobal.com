                           We perform a thorough face-to-face interview where the focus is on the competency of the candidate. The interviewers ask candidates a list of standard questions, and every candidate going through the interview process (for that particular position) will be asked exactly the same questions; ensuring the process is objective and fair.
                        </p>
                       <p>
                           We also place key importance on finding candidates that both appreciate and fit in with the culture of our Client’s organisation.
